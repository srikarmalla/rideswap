## üöÄ Getting Started

This project runs entirely on the client-side and requires no special server setup.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/srikarmalla/rideswap.git](https://github.com/srikarmalla/rideswap.git)
    cd rideswap
    ```

2.  **Open the application:**
    You can simply open the `login.html` file directly in your browser.

    Alternatively, for a more realistic experience, serve the files using a local server.

    * **Using Python:**
        ```bash
        # For Python 3.x
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    * **Using Node.js (with http-server):**
        ```bash
        # Install http-server if you haven't already: npm install -g http-server
        npx http-server
        ```

3.  **Access the application:**
    - If using a local server, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/login.html` in your browser.
    - Create a new account to get started or use existing credentials stored in your browser's local storage.

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

-   **Static Availability**: Vehicle availability is not tracked in real-time.

-   [ ] **Payment Gateway**: Integrate a secure payment system like Stripe or Razorpay.
-   [ ] **Real-time Availability**: Implement a system to track and display vehicle availability in real-time.
-   [ ] **User Reviews**: Allow users to rate and review vehicles and their rental experience.
-   [ ] **Advanced Filtering**: Add advanced search and filtering options (e.g., by price, model, fuel type).
